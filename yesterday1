Yeste1234533333I was young
the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue.
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
the way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed,
the splendid things I planned
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
and only now I see how the years ran away.
Yesterday when I was young
There were so many songs were waiting to be sung,
so many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
and every conversation I can now recall
concerned itself with me and nothing else at all.
esterday, the moon was blue,
nd every crazy day, brought something new to do,
I used my magic age, as if it were a wand,
And never saw the waste, and the emptiness beyond
The game of love I played, with arrogance and pride,
And every flame I lit, soo quickly, quickly died,
The friends I made, all seemed somehow to drift away,
And only I am left, on stage to end the play
Yesterday when I was young
so many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
so many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue.
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday
when I was young.
here are no songs in me that won't be sung
